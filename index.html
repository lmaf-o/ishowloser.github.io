        <p>Who is @coderecon</p>
        <p>@coderecon is a bitch who harasses people on discord and puts them on a site called ishowlosers.site.</p>
        <br>
        <p>He bitches about being a moderator on .gg/ishowspeed and .gg/mcspeed.</p>
        <p>He got cooked by a old granny called Amy nickname Nacho Mama.</p>
        <p>He had an ip grabber that would send people's ip addresses to a discord webhook on his site. luckily it didn't work as the api he was using to grab the ips needed an api key which he didn't have. a result of being a github skid.</p>
        <h1>UPDATE AS OF AUGUST 2024</h1>
        <p>Well, Well, Well. Seems recon aka Kody hasn't learned. racking up a felony charge.</p>
        <a href="https://www.journal-news.net/journal-news/berkeley-county-crime-report/article_509a4abc-a5a1-58ec-b382-cf4c6d73444c.html">Proof</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/exct5h.mp4">Sadly i will* link his dox here. although it's very easy to find. just search "wybrecon" on google with quotes included and you'll find it.</a>
        <p>let's list some of the shit Kody has done since this site came online.</p>
        <p>Became a moderator in a discord server with over 800 thousand members</p>
        <p>Got doxxed and all of his past got exposed. including his dogshit clan that lasted 2 days and him following a minor on tiktok</p>
        <p>Made a dogshit discord bot with chatgpt that would clip youtube livestreams, some retard actually bought it. then because of his dogshit security his bot spammed his free namecheap shitbox server. using up all his storage</p>
        <p>shutdown his ishowlosers and ishowwinners site in less than a month(couldn't afford 10 bucks a month)</p>
        <p>got bullied around like a punching bag between servers(they took his moderator access)</p>
        <p>decided to lie about how he's the victim explaination below</p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>recon started off by renaming himself from wyb to code to try and hide his past. luckily i found it.</p>
        <p>before being known as "coderecon" he got banned from multiple minecraft servers and even epicnpc. yeah, the scummy marketplace.</p>
        <p>then he joined the now dead mcspeed(ishowspeed's minecraft server) and became a mod because of the retarded eastern european owner.</p>
        <p>then he started spreading lies about how i owned a botnet(i don't. it's called ctrl v retard) and how i ddosed him(never done that.) and about how i was blacklisted from the server. causing a retarded black "vc mod"(moderator access for voice channels only) to ban me.</p>
        <p>after that i learned i wasn't the only one. he falsely accused random people of "ratting"(sending malware) and getting them banned. and he would taunt those who weren't getting banned.</p>
        <p>after that a 15 year old administator gave him "vc mod" for no reason. inflating his ego. after which he would continue falsely punishing people because they wouldn't obey him</p>
        <p>the "ishowspeed discord server" would sometimes do "mass unbans" in which everyone would get another chance? simply told he didn't like this and decided to ban me a few minutes after i joined for "blacklisted", whatever that means.</p>
        <p>after getting caught following onlyfans support on his personal twitter he tried downplaying it by saying that his account was "banned for years" even though he literally replied to a tweet a week eariler.</p>
        <p>and now to the somewhat present. he's trying to make it seem that im only doing this because one of my contacts was put on his wall of shame aka "ishowlosers". i would not have included this backstory if he actually learned to not be a dick online.</p>
        <h1>Did You Know?</h1>
        <p>Recon is a felon.</p>
        <p>Recon has been doxxed by others before.</p>
        <p>Recon used to stream on twitch.</p>
        <p>Recon's old name was WYBRecon instead of CodeRecon</p>
        <p>Recon lives with his parents</p>
        <p>Recon bans people for self promotion, yet he self promotes his own dogshit youtube clip bot in the same server.</p>
        <p>Recon lives on discord.</p>
